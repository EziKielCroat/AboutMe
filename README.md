## Who am I?

I am EziKielCroat, I'm a high-level programmer and work with Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.

## About me

For now, my projects include JS/Neural networking and including some low-level backends. PHP, Python and C++ are languages I am still trying to learn or just try read them. I'll be sticking to JS untill I decide what I'd like to do exactly in IT that be front-end developing or working system administrator jobs.
